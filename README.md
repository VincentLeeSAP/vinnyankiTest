# SAPCP_Template

## Template is using UI5 1.46.6 hardcoded link

1. Download Template  
2. Upload to WebIDE   
3. Do a search on the whole project folder and replace com.hcpprototypehcpprototype with com.whatever you want  
4. Also replace com/hcpprototypehcpprototype with com/whatever you want    

  
  
Template has a base controller already set up, routing, and it's using fiori 2.0.   
Every view should extended  the base controller so code needed throughout the application can be put in there (the views in the folder already show this)  
To change to a full screen application change "true" to "false" on line 28 of the Index
